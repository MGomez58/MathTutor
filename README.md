Math tutor project


Here are the two diagrams I have so far. We should plan on finalizing these two and adding the Problem statement in class 11/28.
I am sure we can get the rest of this knocked out in class and get started on building all the necessary components for the 
program in the next week or two. 

Update : I went through and deleted most of the files on the git page and uploaded a backup zip containing those files if for any reason we feel we need to go back to something before we made the latest changes.
